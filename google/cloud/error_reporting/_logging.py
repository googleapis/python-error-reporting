"""Interact with Error Reporting via Logging API.

It's possible to report Error Reporting errors by formatting
structured log messages in Cloud Logging in a given format. This
client provides a mechanism to report errors using that technique.

                        These credentials identify this application to the service.
                        If none are specified, the client will attempt to ascertain
                        the credentials from the environment.

                  that defines ``request()`` with the same interface as
                  :meth:`requests.Session.request`. If not passed, an
                  ``_http`` object is created that is bound to the
                  ``credentials`` for the current object.
                  This parameter should be considered private, and could
                  change in the future.

        The client info used to send a user-agent string along with API
        requests. If ``None``, then default info will be used. Generally,
        you only need to set this if you're developing your own library
