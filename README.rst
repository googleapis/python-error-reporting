Python Client for Error Reporting API
=====================================

|preview| |pypi| |versions|

`Error Reporting API`_: counts, analyzes and aggregates the crashes in your running cloud services.  A centralized error management interface displays the results with sorting and filtering capabilities. A dedicated view shows the error details: time chart, occurrences, affected user count, first and last seen dates and a cleaned exception stack trace. Opt-in to receive email and mobile alerts on new errors.

Quick Start
-----------

In order to use this library, you first need to go through the following steps:

1. `Select or create a Cloud Platform project.`_
2. `Enable billing for your project.`_
3. `Enable the Error Reporting API.`_
4. `Setup Authentication.`_

.. _Select or create a Cloud Platform project.: https://console.cloud.google.com/project
.. _Enable billing for your project.: https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/modify-project#enable_billing_for_a_project
.. _Enable the Error Reporting API.:  https://cloud.google.com/error-reporting
.. _Setup Authentication.: https://googleapis.dev/python/google-api-core/latest/auth.html

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Install this library in a virtual environment using `venv`_. `venv`_ is a tool that
creates isolated Python environments. These isolated environments can have separate
versions of Python packages, which allows you to isolate one project's dependencies
from the dependencies of other projects.

With `venv`_, it's possible to install this library without needing system
install permissions, and without clashing with the installed system
dependencies.

.. _`venv`: https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html
